# MinecraftStatusBot
Access the IP and status of a Minecraft server in Discord.

Uses ident.me to find the current IP and reports it in the Discord server if it changes. Good for people who don't want/can't use a DDNS service instead.
Also features rich presence and other commands to see info about the server, like how many people are playing.
